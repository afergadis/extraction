Herrerasaurus was one of the earliest dinosaurs.
All known fossils of this carnivorous dinosaur have been discovered in rocks of Carnian age (late Triassic according to the ICS, dated to 231.4 million years ago) in northwestern Argentina
For many years, the classification of Herrerasaurus was unclear because it was known from very fragmentary remains.
It is a member of the Herrerasauridae, a family of similar genera that were among the earliest of the dinosaurian evolutionary radiation
