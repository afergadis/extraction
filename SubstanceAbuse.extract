Substance abuse, also known as drug abuse, is a patterned use of a substance (drug) in which the user consumes the substance in amounts or with methods which are harmful to themselves or others.
The term "drug abuse" does not exclude dependency, but is otherwise used in a similar manner in nonmedical contexts
Some of the drugs most often associated with this term include alcohol, substituted amphetamines,barbiturates, benzodiazepines (particularly alprazolam, temazepam, diazepam and clonazepam), cocaine, methaqualone, and opioids.
Use of these drugs may lead to criminal penalty in addition to possible physical, social, and psychological harm, both strongly depending on local jurisdiction
Long term personality changes in individuals may occur as well.
