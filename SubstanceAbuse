Substance abuse, also known as drug abuse, is a patterned use of a substance (drug) in which the user consumes the substance in amounts or with methods which are harmful to themselves or others.
The term "drug abuse" does not exclude dependency, but is otherwise used in a similar manner in nonmedical contexts.
The terms have a huge range of definitions related to taking a psychoactive drug or performance enhancing drug for a non-therapeutic or non-medical effect.
All of these definitions imply a negative judgment of the drug use in question (compare with the term responsible drug use for alternative views).
Some of the drugs most often associated with this term include alcohol, substituted amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines (particularly alprazolam, temazepam, diazepam and clonazepam), cocaine, methaqualone, and opioids.
Use of these drugs may lead to criminal penalty in addition to possible physical, social, and psychological harm, both strongly depending on local jurisdiction.
There are many cases in which criminal or antisocial behavior occur when the person is under the influence of a drug.
Long term personality changes in individuals may occur as well.
Other definitions of drug abuse fall into four main categories: public health definitions, mass communication and vernacular usage, medical definitions, and political and criminal justice definitions.
Substance abuse is prevalent with an estimated 120 million users of hard drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and other synthetic drugs.

Substance abuse is a form of substance-related disorder.
