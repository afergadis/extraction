Caloric restriction (CR), or calorie restriction, is a dietary regimen that is based on low calorie intake.
"Low" can be defined relative to the subject's previous intake before intentionally restricting calories, or relative to an average person of similar body type
No clinical trial has been performed involving humans
Calorie restriction is a feature of several dietary regimens, including the Okinawa diet[5] and the CRON-diet.
Sometimes calorie restriction is called calorie restriction with adequate nutrition (or CRAN) to clarify that this is done while still keeping healthy levels of protein, vitamins and minerals while lowering calories.
