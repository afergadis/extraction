Nadaswaram
The nadaswaram is the world's loudest non-brass acoustic instrument. It is a wind instrument with a hardwood body and a large flaring bell made of wood or metal.
It is played in almost all Hindu weddings and temples of the South Indian tradition.[2] It is part of the family of instruments known as mangala vadya. The instrument is usually played in pairs, and accompanied by a pair of drums called thavil; it can also be accompanied with a drone from a similar oboe called the ottu.
Construction
The nadaswaram contains three parts namely, kuzhal, thimiru, andanasu. It is a double reed instrument with a conical bore which gradually enlarges toward the lower end. The top portion has a metal staple which is inserted a small metallic cylinder which carries the mouthpiece made of reed. A small ivory or horn needle is attached to the instrument and allows free passage of air. A metallic bell forms the bottom end of the instrument.
Traditionally the body of the nadaswaram is made out of a tree.
The nadaswaram has seven finger-holes, and five additional holes which can be stopped to modify the tone. The nadaswaram has a range of two and a half octaves. Semi and quarter tones are produced bby adjusting the pressure and strength of the air-flow into the pipe. It is largely an outdoor instrument.
Players
American composers have expressed admiration for the nadaswaram, and a few jazz musicians have taken up the instrument.
