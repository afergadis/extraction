Caloric restriction (CR), or calorie restriction, is a dietary regimen that is based on low calorie intake.
"Low" can be defined relative to the subject's previous intake before intentionally restricting calories, or relative to an average person of similar body type.
CR without malnutrition has been shown to work in a variety of species, among them yeast, fish, rodents and dogs to decelerate the biological aging process, resulting in longer maintenance of youthful health and an increase in both median and maximum lifespan.

No clinical trial has been performed involving humans. Two trials have been performed involving primates, but have not demonstrated increases in median lifespan.
A study of rhesus monkeys begun in 1987 by the National Institute on Aging published results in August 2012 that found evidence of health benefits, but did not demonstrate increased median lifespan.
A study by the University of Wisconsin beginning in 1989 is still ongoing.
Research on maximum life span in that study is still ongoing.

Calorie restriction is a feature of several dietary regimens, including the Okinawa diet and the CRON-diet.
Sometimes calorie restriction is called calorie restriction with adequate nutrition (or CRAN) to clarify that this is done while still keeping healthy levels of protein, vitamins and minerals while lowering calories.
